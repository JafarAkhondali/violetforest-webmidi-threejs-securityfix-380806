Webmidi-ready Three JS examples for VJing in the browser with midi controllers.

This repository comes with webmidi.js, the entire Three.js library with native examples, and a custom webmidi.js script to pull values from a connected midi controller and store them as variables to be used in any javascript program. 

## Step 1: Configure webmidi.js and test your midi controller with it per these instructions.

## Step 2: Find the controllers you want to use and store them as a variable.

## Step 3: Use that variable in the rest of your program.
